# CMA-ES_Optimized_RL

Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolutionary Strategy (CMA-ES) for hyperparameter optimization on Deep-Q-Network

## What is CMA-ES?

From [The CMA Evolution Strategy](http://cma.gforge.inria.fr/) homepage:

> The CMA-ES (Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy) is an evolutionary algorithm for difficult non-linear non-convex black-box optimization problems in continuous domain. It is considered as state-of-the-art in evolutionary computation and has been adopted as one of the standard tools for continuous optimization in many (probably hundreds of) research labs and industrial environments around the world.

## Why use CMA-ES?

> RL problems are [notoriously sensitive](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/deep-reinforcement-learning-on-gcp-using-hyperparameters-and-cloud-ml-engine-to-best-openai-gym-games) to hyperparameters, which means itâ€™s necessary to evaluate many different hyperparameters. The prominant obstacle in this process is laborious effort required by human experts. Using CMA-ES is an attempt to solve this problem, by automating the hyperparameter searching process.

## Result
> Agents trained with hyperparameters optimzied by CMA-ES performs significantly better than the baseline DQN from [stable-baseline](https://stable-baselines.readthedocs.io/en/master/index.html). For more explanation refer to the poster `Tokyo_Tech_Poster.pdf`
